<p class="aboutp">
“The Whole World is Watching” is a living archive that documents police violence  on a global scale/stage. On WWW we employ crowd-sourced video to documents incidents of police interaction.  WWW was spawned in response to the number of black people murdered by the United States police force in the year of 2014. The boiling point of this frustration being the murders of  Eric Gardner, Tamir Rice and John Crawford to name only a few. In the face of several failures of the United States’ legal system, we seek new platforms for accountability. Although the video footage of Eric Gardner’s murder did not lead to an indictment this footage and visibility spawned outrage and action.As we continue to fight for legislative measures to hold police accountable for abuses of power, this energy is invaluable. WWW aims to create a platform for this sort of visibility through the creation of a living archive of police interactions.</p>

The Whole World is Watching is an ever-evolving project. As WWW grows we hope for this platform to function as an international document of police-violence. Started by a collective of individuals, we have created this site not to yield profits but to share information. For this reason PBVD is entirely ad-free.
